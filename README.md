##CMPE382-Operating Systems Project #2-Creating Dictionary for the AOL Dataset.

and finds how many times a certain entry has been written.

The main purpose of this project is to examine how different approaches affect the performance. The project tests how a single thread and multiple threads affect performance of dictionary creation.
